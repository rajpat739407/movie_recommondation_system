# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System - Project Summary

## 📊 Project Overview
A comprehensive movie recommendation system built using collaborative filtering techniques capable of handling large-scale datasets.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Data**: 33M+ ratings, 86K+ movies, 307K+ users
- **Sparsity**: 99.66% (typical for recommendation systems)
- **Algorithms**: Collaborative Filtering (User-based, Item-based, Matrix Factorization)
- **Memory Optimization**: KNN approximation, sampling, sparse matrices

## 📈 Model Performance
- **Matrix Factorization**: 42% explained variance with 100 components
- **Training Time**: ~75 seconds for SVD on full dataset
- **Memory Efficient**: No memory errors despite large dataset

## 🎯 Key Features
1. **Multiple Recommendation Methods**
   - User-based collaborative filtering
   - Item-based collaborative filtering  
   - Matrix Factorization (SVD)
   - Hybrid approach

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - Sparse matrix operations
   - KNN for approximate similarity
   - Sampling for large computations

3. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Comprehensive data analysis
   - Sparsity calculation
   - Performance metrics

## 🚀 Usage
```python
# Get recommendations for a user
recommendations = engine.get_user_recommendations(
    user_id=1, 
    method='hybrid', 
    n_recommendations=10
)

# Find similar movies
similar_movies = engine.get_movie_similarity(movie_id=1, n_similar=5)
